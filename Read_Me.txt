The database contains the information required to run N-body simualtions of 
star clusters subject to time-dependent realistic tidal field, 
where he tidal foreces are generated by galaxy scale N-body simulations.
For further details on the methods and a description of the galaxy
models we refer to L. J., Bekki K. & Hurley, J. R., 2016, MNRAS, 462, 2861.

For each galactic model we included a visualisation of the galaxy, 
both face-on and edge-on, and present the orbits of several clusters following 
different galactic trajectories. 

For each orbit we weated a directory in chich we included the following files:

-> ax_coeff.dat, ay_coeff.dat, az_coeff.dat : coeffients of the polynomial 
interpolation of the tidal field, required by NBODY6. These files have to 
be included in the directory from which the simulation is launched (unless 
otherwise specified by the user).

-> inputX : example of input file for NBODY6 for a cluster with 10k stars 
following the specific orbit

-> extrct.dat: results of an N-body simulations of a star clusters run with
the inputX file. The meaning of the different columns is described in the 
Plot_parameters.m script.

-> Orbit.eps : visualisation of the orbit on the (x,y), (x,z), (t,r) and (R,z)
planes

-> Plot_orbit.m : MATLAB  script to visualise the orbit

-> Plot_parameters.m : MATLAB script to visualise the results of the
N-body simulation. 

-> Tidal_radius.m : visualisation of the theoretical tidal limit of the 
star cluster along the orbit as a function of the galacticentric distance


The results of the simulations with NBODY6 included in the database have been
run on the swinSTAR and gSTAR supercomputers at Swinburne University of 
Technology funded by Swinburne and the Australian Government?s Education 
Investment Fund.
The simulations have been run on  single 16-core node with an NVIDIA Kepler 
K10 graphic processing unit (GPU).
